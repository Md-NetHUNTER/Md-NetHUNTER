## About Me
Hello! My name is Md-NetHUNTER, and Iâ€™m currently in 9th grade. My journey into technology began when I was 13 years old, in 7th grade, and since then, I've developed a strong passion for all things tech.

## Interests
I am particularly interested in:

Web Development: I have created several projects using HTML and CSS, where I wrote all the code myself.
Programming: I have experience with Java, JavaScript, Python, and more. While I often use AI for some code, I make sure to debug and refine my projects independently.
Financial Aspirations: I am eager to learn how to generate income through my tech skills.
## Skills
Languages: HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Python
Problem-Solving: I enjoy tackling bugs and finding solutions independently.
Continuous Learning: Currently learning Java in school to enhance my programming knowledge.
## Projects
Feel free to check out my projects, which showcase my skills in web development and programming. Each project reflects my journey of learning and growing in technology.
